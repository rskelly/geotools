# Creating Reflectance Regression Coefficients

The **refl_regress.py** script is a multi-step process for producing regression coefficients and plots from input data.

There are three main steps:

1) Sample the apparent reflectance raster using a spreadsheet containing sample points.
2) Perform the regression.
3) Transform the raster using the generated coefficients.

There is an optional intermediate step which allows the plotting of input values.
